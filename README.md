BERT + Ernie is a great, lightweight RPC setup that offers a great tool to have knowledge on. Sadly,
a lot of information is not easily available on it. When I went to deploy a BERT + Ernie setup, I had
to overcome a lot of challenges along the way. With all of those challenges solved, Ernie has proved
incredibly reliable and performant for me.

This repo offers a *very simple* demo of BERT + Ernie and integrating with Rails. It is presented in several
issues:

* [What is BERT and Ernie?](https://github.com/sb8244/bert-talk/issues/4)
* [Beginning Steps](https://github.com/sb8244/bert-talk/issues/1)
* [Now Integrate with Rails (more advanced)](https://github.com/sb8244/bert-talk/issues/2)
* [Cool Patterns](https://github.com/sb8244/bert-talk/issues/3)
* [Gotchas](https://github.com/sb8244/bert-talk/issues/5)
